This project was given to me and my ICS 111 class by Jason Leigh. It was a way to introduce the class to game development and inspire some of the new programmers to pursue coding and encourage them to keep trying and persevere. The requirements of the program are to have three racers and one of those racers you are controlling by pressing the keys 'W' and 'S'in a sequential order. While you are controlling your character's movement, the CPU is generating a random value to either increase their movement or to decrease it. This forces you to continue pressing 'W' and 'S' to the point where you just might end up breaking your keyboard just so that you can win.

With this project I've run into some difficulties with meeting the requirements, these included syntax errors, my code not loading my images for the task and missing files in my eclipse. All of this brought mentally straining hours and frustration, this was mostly due to the fact that it was my first time programming on Eclipse and having minimal knowledge on this editing/programming software. What solved this problem and helped me complete this project was my TA, and he took a file from my Eclipse admin folder and he got my work to finish. This actually made me realize that sometimes it's not your coding that has the problem it could be the files that are in your project. 

With this project, it gave me an idea of how it's like to develop a game even if it's something small like this project. This also taught me that it doesn't hurt to ask someone for help and receive feedback from them, it's actually good to receive another person's thoughts on how they perceive the task and how they would complete it. Just like my TA, whenever someone needs help on a problem and they ask me to help them, I really try to guide them and help them understand how to get the answer in a way that would be easy for them to understand.
