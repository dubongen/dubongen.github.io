My personal project that I felt needed to be in here is one of my choreographys that performed and filmed. Now this is not  just any typical dance choreography, it's the first one that I was able to have the courage to preform and film it.

Live performances could make anyone nervous and for me it was a big obstacle that I needed to overcome. Normally if I have to present a topic or do any type of public speaking, I'll almost have a nervous breakdown. This is not due to being nervous or not wanting to do a presentation type of task, for me and most people it's fear. The fear of failing in front of a group of people or their perception of me after a presentationis what creates self doubt, this is why to overcome your fears I believe it's to face what you're most afraid of.

Now the purpose of this project of mine is to document my growth of an activity I love to do and how can I improve or find my own style of dancing. Which this shows the begining of what I like to believe in, more performances and show cases that I can present my own art.
