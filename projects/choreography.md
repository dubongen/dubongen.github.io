My personal project that I felt needed to be in here is one of my choreographies that were performed and filmed. Now, this is not just any typical dance choreography, it's the first one that I was able to have the courage to perform and film. It presents an obstacle that many of us have, public presentations/activities. Many people have the fear of public speaking or presenting a piece in front of an audience, before doing this project I was having second thoughts on actually performing.

Live performances could make anyone nervous and for me, it was a big obstacle that I needed to overcome. Normally if I have to present a topic or do any type of public speaking, I'll almost have a panic attack. This is not due to being nervous or not wanting to do a presentation type of task, for me and for most people its fear. The fear of failing in front of a group of people or their perception of me after a presentation, this is how I created self-doubt in myself. I'm coming to a point in my life where I wished I've done certain activities in the past, you could call this a mid-life crisis but I like to call it a wake-up call for me. That's why when I saw this opportunity to present my hobby/passion to people I took it as a challenge that I need to complete. This is why I believe that the only way to overcome your fears is to face it and look at it more as a challenge. This can be said with anything in life, whether it's taking exams, meeting new people, or even moving to a new place this can all be presented as a challenge for us to complete.

That's why the purpose of this project is to document my growth of an activity that I love to do and I was afraid of showing people because I had doubt in myself and I felt that I wouldn't have been able to withstand the criticism. However, its this type of feedback that will help become a better dancer, which possibly could lead to more performances and showcases that I can present my own art and improvement in my style.
