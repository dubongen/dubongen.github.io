This project was given to me and my ICS 111 class by Jason Leigh. It was a way to introduce the class to game development and inspire some of new programers to persue coding and encourage them to keep trying and perservere. The requirements of the program is to have three racers and one of those racers you are controlling by pressing the keys 'W' and 'S'in a sequential order. While you are controlling your character's movement, the CPU is generating a random value to either increase their movement or to decrease it. This forces you to continuously pressing 'W' and 'S' to the point where you just might end up breaking your keyboard just so that you can win.

With this project I've ran into some difficulties with meeting the requirements, these included syntax errors, my code not loading my images for the task and missing files in my eclipse. All of this brought mentally straining hours and frustration, this was mostly due to the fact that it was my first time programming on Eclipse and having minimal knowledge on this editing/programming software. What solved this problem and helped me complete this project was my TA, and he took a file from my
