In Professor Ravi's class, he taught us the use of C and C++ and he gave us homework and projects so we can become proficient in the language and a better computer programmer.

This project had its various difficulties with getting your code to work. I believe with the first project which was designing an address book so that you are able to add someone's address and delete it. The hardest part for me with that specific project was releasing the allocated memory from the heap and the importance of releasing the heap is so that you won't have a memory leak, which could lead your computer to run slow. Now coding in C was pretty hard to do, but thankfully with converting this project into C++ it was a little more bearable and I had fewer problems I had to deal with compared to my first one. 

This project helped me gain experience with C and C++, also the fact that we had to convert our project from one language to another posed another obstacle that I was able to overcome. In my opinion, I do believe that C is a powerful language, but the difficulty and the tedious work you have to put in can be overwhelming. The difficulty of this programming language was the same as learning any new language, it's tough and I had to put more effort into learning the language more than acing the class. However, with the effort I put into learning this new profound language the pay off was exactly what I believed, rewarding and with the knowledge and conviction to learn it I believe that I'll be able to learn more languages throughout my studies.
