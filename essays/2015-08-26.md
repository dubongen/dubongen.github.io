Personally I feel like as Choreographer for dancing, I just love the fact on how I'm able to be creative and express my emotions and feelings through the ways of movement and entertainment. I believe that's one of the reasons why I like being a Computer Science Major because you're able to learn and see other people's style of code and you're able to derive from that and create your own style of coding where it becomes your art form. You're also able to learn various different languages that are powerful for certain tasks.

With this Software Engineering class I hope to gain much more knowledge on programming languages and expand my skills with them. I want to have a wide range of skills in programming because when I further my education I want be able to hone the languages I learned. Which leads me to interviews and job hunting, I'll have the knowledge and the ability to demonstrate what I learned and what I've practiced in my undergraduate days.

According to the structure of this class we are going to learn new progamming languages within these upcoming 4 months. That is why I believe that I'll enjoy the teachings of this class, only because I like to learn new and interesting topics. So far this class have been strenuous but I believe it's a way for me to improve.
