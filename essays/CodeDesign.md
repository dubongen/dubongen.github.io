When I first hear the question "what are design patterns?", the first thing that comes to mind is the most general idea and probably the most ignorant answer "it's a type of pattern that you design or create". This answer may be the same for other people, but as I started to think about it more I then came to the realization that this represents a type of template that most computer science majors use. Unlike your usual code that you create from scratch, a design pattern is more of a template that have the basic code layout that anyone could use and you can add or alter the template to your liking.

After taking ICS 314 I only now realized that we've been using a design pattern almost throughout the class, from the start of using html to using meteor we would use a basic template, where we would then alter the code inorder to complete our given task. Specific example of these occurances would be our weekly WODs, we would be given a website and we would have to alter the meteor template or the code that we were given earlier inthe week and we would have to model our own copy of the website to the original one that professor Johnson gives us. However, the biggest question I think that should be addressed is "Is this considered as copying?", 

Now in my opinion
