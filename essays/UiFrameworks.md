Learning HTML was a great experience, I learned how to develop websites and incorperate CSS with it too. However, using strictly HTML and CSS can be very difficult if you're developing a website, mostly because those two languages does not have the capability(in my opinion) to create a useable and appealing website, that's why I believe that you need to use a type of framework like Semantic UI to achieve these goals.

Before this class didn't have any knowledge on Semantic UI, Bootstrap, or any other framework out there, as far as web design I only knew that HTML was apart of it. But after learning and practicing with Semantic UI, I really enjoyed the role it plays with HTML, and I know that there are probably better frameworks that are easier and much more powerful than Semantic UI, the fact is I never worked with those types of frameworks. So far with my first time experience with Semantic UI I believe that it's a great framework to use when developing nice websites, only because when we was given a task to recreate any website of our choice I chose a website that I consistantly go to when I'm bored. That website is called Kinjaz.com, at first glance at the website I was extremely intimidated because I needed a video to autoplay in the background and a directory with a transparent background. As I was working on this assignment I was getting frustrated mostly because I couldn't figure out how to embed a video in HTML. But once I figured out those couple lines of code I felt a sense of acomplishment, that feeling of working so hard just to have this one aestheic impress some of my peers makes all the frustration that I went through worth it.

<div class="ui two column grid container"
  <div class="column">
    <div class="ui large rounded images">
      <img class="ui image" src="Original Website.png">
    </div>
  </div>
  
  <div class="column">
    <div class="ui large rounded images">
      <img class="ui image" src="Original Website.png">
    </div>
</div>

Now as you see in the pictures above I don't think I could come close to my website recreation using strictly HTML and CSS.
