<h2>Problem</h2>
Hawaii is full of many great hikes some well known some hidden. The ones that are well known are being eroded extremely quickly due to the high traffic rates, but if there was a reliable comprehensive site to find other hikes we could extend the life of all hikes. Hiking is a popular hobby for many UH students but finding new hikes can be difficult because the information is dispersed and unreliable.

<h2>Solution</h2>
Our final project idea is where possible hikes on the island of O'ahu are listed. The listing information would consist of names of the hike, location, length, and difficulty, this can range from the type of terrain it is during certain types of weather and how steep the incline is. Admins can add new hikes if it's not listed on the app/website, this offers more opportunities and it will provide a centralized, comprehensive, and reliable information source for hikes. Students can log in to favorite or queue hikes of interest. Logged in user and even non-users are able to browse through the hikes and even search/sort by certain attributes.

<h2>Approach</h2>
Hiking Index will have three user rolls. Non-users can browse and search through hikes. Users can log in with an email and password to save and queue hikes. Admins can edit hike information.

<h2>Beyond the Basics</h2>
Use the user's location to find hikes
Suggest hikes based on what the user has liked/queued
Display how many people have liked/queued a hike
