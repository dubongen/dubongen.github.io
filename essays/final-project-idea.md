<h1>
Problem
</h1>
Hawaii is full of many great hikes some well known some hidden. The ones that are well known are being eroded extremely quickly due to the high traffic rates, but if there was a reliable comprehensive site to find other hikes we could extend the life of all hikes. Hiking is a popular hobby for many UH students but finding new hikes can be difficult because the information is dispersed and unreliable.

Solution
Our final project idea is where possible hikes on the island of O'ahu are listed. The listing information would consists of  name of the hike, location, length, and difficulty, this can range from the type of terrain  . Bonus points if you can type in an address and get hikes in that area(not just hikes near you but hikes near the area you inputted so you can plan ahead). Bonus points if you can type in search parameters like waterfall and executions like no path.
