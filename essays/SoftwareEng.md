Personally, I feel like as Choreographer for dancing, I just love the fact on how I'm able to be creative and express my emotions and feelings through the ways of movement and entertainment. I believe that's one of the reasons why I like being a Computer Science Major because you're able to learn and see other people's style of code and you're able to derive from that and create your own style of coding where it becomes your art form. You're also able to learn various different languages that are powerful for certain tasks.

When I was a kid I never imagined that I would ever have this thought of learning various languages and material to become better at programming. Realistically I didn't really think of much during those days, I honestly didn't think I would be working with computers during college, but look where I am, Majoring in ICS. As a kid, I was more focused on playing video games than working with computers or even participating in hobbies, all I wanted to do was to stay inside and have fun. But as I grew older I became much more interested in coding, hobbies, and learning new material in school. That's why I believe taking this Software Engineering class, I am able to gain much more knowledge of programming languages and expand my skills with them. I want to have a wide range of skills in programming because when I further my education I want to be able to hone the languages I learned. Which leads me to interviews and job hunting, I'll have the knowledge and the ability to demonstrate what I learned and what I've practiced in my undergraduate days.

According to the structure of this class, we are going to learn new programming languages within these upcoming 4 months. To me I do see this more as a challenge than a hassle, it might be irritating to grasp the idea of how the language but this can be said with learning any new topic. So far this class has been strenuous but I believe it's a way for me to improve. Like all things in life, when you learn new material it can be challenging to understand and get the concept of it, but when you do figure it out the next step for you is to retain the material and use it to your benefits.
