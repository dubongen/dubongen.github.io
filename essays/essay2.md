In my personal opinion I enjoy using Javascript, I enjoy how the language is similar to C++ but it has a more of a Java style of coding. I generally like C more than Javascript because I spent a lot of time coding in that language and it's a really good language to program with, though it's quite difficult to wrap your head around it. As a comlpete newbie in Javascript I'm able to say that the language is starting to grow on me. I would even take the consideration of wanting to code in this language instead of C or C++.

Javascript to me is a good language and I would choose to code in Javascript over C++ but I don't think I could say that I like to use it more than C. Programming in C can be a strenuous task but according to Professor Ravi, it's a powerful language and I have to agree with him because C is one of the few languages that you would have to make trace table in order to see what's wrong with your code and how to correct it. Also I used C for quite a while after taking ICS 212 last year, however as I'm learning how to code in Javascript I'm finding it more likable than the previous languages I learned with the exception of C of course.  But using this language so far in my Software Engineering class, I can't really say from a Software Engineer perspective that this is a good language because there's probably better languages for me to use instead of this I just didn't learn it yet.

What I can say about my Software Engineering class is that I enjoy having it as a "Atheletic" Software Engineering class. I say "Atheletic" with quotes because you could consider it as an atheletic activity but to me it's just a sped up version of learning various programming languages in 4 months worth of class. I do enjoy how I'm able to learn something new in programming every week, however I do have to say the work load is a little much for some people(me) to work on, this does not mean that I am not able to handle work load, I just need to get used to it.
